# motion_tracking
## Summer research project of motion tracking for C-Alex by using HTC vive

### Experiment 0: Data Acquisition
For the position and orientation:

The position is based on global coordinate with the start point (0,1,0) at the intersection of two base stations. Note: the unit is meter, left-handed coordinate.

The oriention is the eular angles. Note: left-handed coordinate.


Next Step:
The position showed in Inspector is different with the data printed in Scripts.
Looks like a difference between local and world positions. Need to fix it.
